# Machi Awase

So I was looking around, and I don't think there are any APIs that give you train line data.
So I am making one. Slowly!
Right now I am just hand typing JSON for station / train line info. Real pain in the ass. Check the constants folder if you want to see.
You can spin up the project like:

1. ``` git clone https://github.com/seanluse41/machi-awase.git```
2. ``` cd machi-awase ```
3. ``` npm install ```
4. ``` npm run dev ```

If you contribute, you get 50% of the profits. ;)
